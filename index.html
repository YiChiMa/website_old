<h1>Who Am I?</h1>
<p>
Hi, my name is Simon Ma, or if you prefer my legal name, Yichi Ma. I am a Chinese student from Shenzhen who currently studies at Saint Fracnis High School in Mountain View, California, and expected to graduate in May 2018. 
<br><br>
I have been interested in visual art when I was in elementary school. I began seriously designing on both traditional and electronic media as a freshman in high school. Most of my visual artworks are ranging from chorcoal sketching to html website designing.
<br><br>
I am also passionate in learning about anything related to technologies and science. My current interests includes programming and chemistry. Although I just started exploring the world of computer science, I am already loving it. I wish I have opportunities to work with and to learn from talented individuals.
<br><br>
Besides those interests, I have many other fun habits. I like to try as many different activities as I can. Poeple can find me playing not-on-tempo disco beats on a drumset, running 3 miles at a tempo of 10, playing badminton with my racket frame, reading Jin Yong novels while listening to pop music, and even doing chinese calligraphy.
